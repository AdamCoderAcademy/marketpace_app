R7. 	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

- Problems faced by Farmers having large companies control their flow of sales, profits, quotas that must be met.
- Consumers are not getting the freshest produce available to them.

R8. 	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

- Farmers are heavily reliant on large supermarket chains to sell their produce. 
- Because of this local produce can be often undercut when the produce is imported cheaper from an international market. 
- This can then effect the profits made on the Farmers end. They are expected to produce fruits or vegetables that aren't in season which requires more time and resources to provide something that ends up being subpar just because the supermarkets demand it to be in stock. 
- Farmers need to meet certain quotas for quantities and delivery times which if the conditions aren't met could reduce the the final profits received by the Farmer. 
- Consumers don't always have time to visit a Farmers Market.
- Consumers should be able to get the freshest produce for their money.
